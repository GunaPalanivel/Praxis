# Praxis MissionOps — Final Execution Plan (v3.0)

> **Status**: 17 implementation issues (`#22 → #38`) + 1 tracker issue (`#39`). Pivot to MissionOps locked. Rootly real-data integration locked. Composable rubrics locked. Unsloth + multi-turn GRPO training pipeline locked.
> **Hackathon**: OpenEnv India 2026 — submission deadline ≤ 15 hours from T+0.
> **Theme**: #2 — (Super) Long-Horizon Planning & Instruction Following.
> **Plan source of truth**: [`idea/Plan/github_issues.md`](./github_issues.md), [`idea/Plan/Architecture/*`](./Architecture/), [`idea/Plan/Demo/*`](./Demo/), [`idea/Plan/Submission/*`](./Submission/), [`idea/Plan/Project/DecisionLog.md`](./Project/DecisionLog.md), [`idea/Plan/Project/EvidenceIndex.md`](./Project/EvidenceIndex.md).
>
> **v3.0 patch summary**: Phase 14 collapses Phases 11–13 of v2.1 into a single MissionOps push driven by the `FlawsToProduction/` audit. Old Issues #1–#21 are superseded (closed/folded). New issues `#22 → #38` are owner-mapped 6/6/6 across Architect / TechLead / SDE; `#39` is the tracker that gates submission.

| --- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | Theme angle                    | MissionOps — long-horizon SRE missions with planning, memory, and recovery as first-class skills. | ADR-16 |
| 2   | Real-world data                | Rootly AI Labs `logs-dataset` vendored into `data/artifacts/` with Apache-2.0 NOTICE.             | ADR-17 |

## 2. The pitch (60 seconds, MissionOps cut) — `Demo/Narrative.md`

> "Production incidents take 4–6 hours. Today's agents fail at long-horizon SRE work because their context fills with noise, they don't plan, and they don't recover from disturbances. Praxis MissionOps is an OpenEnv where the agent runs an 8-phase production failure with scattered instructions, hidden dependencies, and real Rootly logs — earning credit for planning, recovery, and memory through four composable rubrics, not just for fixing the final symptom. Our trained Qwen agent jumps from a 0.18 baseline to 0.74 — a 4.1× lift — and the rollout shows it actually re-plans when we inject a disturbance. That's MissionOps: long-horizon, process-aware, and grounded in real production data."

## 5. Phase 14 — MissionOps push (Plan v3.0)

> Phases 1–13 are sealed (audit findings folded into the issue body of `#22`). Phase 14 is one wave, three lanes, six waves of work on the wall clock. Issue ↔ wave mapping is the single source of truth for delivery.

### 5.1 Lanes

| Lane                              | Issues                       | Total |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- |
| **Architect** (`@GunaPalanivel`)  | #22, #23, #24, #37, #38, #39 | 6     |
| **TechLead** (`@Gokul287`)        | #25, #26, #27, #31, #32, #33 | 6     |
| **SDE** (`@snehasneha56526-arch`) | #28, #29, #30, #34, #35, #36 | 6     |

### 5.2 Waves and deliverables

#### Wave 0 — Safety + correctness foundation (T+0 → T+1h)

- `#22` *Safety bundle*: replace `threading.Lock` → `asyncio.Lock`, add slowapi rate-limit (60/min on `/step` + `/reset`), uvicorn `CMD ["uvicorn",...,"--host","0.0.0.0","--port","7860"]`, raise success thresholds out of triviality (`server/reward.py` policy adjust).
- **Validation**: `pytest -q` 289+ green, `tests/test_concurrent_sessions.py` PASS, `tests/test_rate_limit.py` PASS, `openenv validate` PASS.

#### Wave 1 — Reward foundation (T+1h → T+2h)

- `#23` *Outcome × efficiency score*: implement `compute_task_score(outcome, steps_used, max_steps)` in `praxis_env/scoring.py`, expose in `/state.task_score`, fail tests if formula drifts.
- `#25` design phase started in parallel.

#### Wave 2 — Composable rubrics + planning skeleton (T+2h → T+4h)

- `#24` *Composable Rubrics*: refactor `server/reward.py` into `rubrics/{planning,memory,recovery,terminal}.py`; engine asserts weights sum to 1.0 ±1e-6.
- `#25` *MissionPlan + planning actions*: add `praxis_env/mission_plan.py`, wire `create_plan` / `revise_plan` / `checkpoint` / `submit_report` / `request_clarification` through `command_parser.py` and `praxis_environment.py`.

#### Wave 3 — MissionOps + manifest (T+4h → T+6h)

- `#26` *MissionScenario phases + scattered + recovery*: rewrite `praxis_env/scenarios/cascading_platform_failure.py` as 8-phase mega-mission with scattered instructions, hidden dependencies, and disturbance injection.
- `#29` *openenv.yaml + `/metadata`*: refresh manifest (rubric weights, data sources block) and `GET /metadata`.
- `#30` *3-row baseline scores*: produce `docs/baseline_scores.md` (random / no-memory / SRE-prompt) over 4 scenarios × 5 seeds.

#### Wave 4 — Real-data + memory-leak excerpts + tests (T+6h → T+8h)

- `#27` *ArtifactStore + Rootly vendoring*: implement `praxis_env/artifacts.py`, vendor sample under `data/artifacts/` with `LICENSE-3rd-party.md` + `NOTICE.md`.
- `#28` *memory-leak + Rootly excerpts*: inject runbook/log excerpts via `ArtifactStore` into the `memory-leak` scenario; reward credit only when content is recalled across the cutoff.
- `#34` *Test suite — rubrics + artifacts + mission*: add `tests/test_rubrics.py`, `tests/test_mission_scenario_phases.py`, `tests/test_artifacts.py`, `tests/test_planning_actions.py`, `tests/test_score_formula.py`.

#### Wave 5 — Trainer + receipts + benchmark (T+8h → T+11h)

- `#31` *`scripts/train_praxis_grpo.py`*: Unsloth + TRL `environment_factory` with multi-turn GRPO turn aggregator, parallel sessions, Trackio/WandB logging.
- `#35` *Determinism + runtime + resource receipts*: `tests/test_determinism.py` (5-seed reproducibility), `docs/runtime_receipt.md` (< 20 min on vCPU=2/8 GB), `docs/resource_receipt.md`.
- `#36` *`GET /benchmark`*: read `docs/baseline_scores.md`, return JSON; happy path + missing-file + extra-fields tests.

#### Wave 6 — Training run + rollout + Space (T+11h → T+13h)

- `#32` *Training run + curves + 4th baseline row*: capture `docs/figures/loss_curve.png` + `docs/figures/reward_curve.png`; append the trained-Qwen row to `docs/baseline_scores.md` (the 4-row gap table).
- `#33` *Before/after rollout — trophy moment*: `docs/rollout_before.md` + `docs/rollout_after.md` from real `/step` traces; same seed; show ≥ 4× lift on the MissionOps mega-mission.
- `#37` *HF Space + smoke + Dockerfile prod*: pin `requirements.txt`, ship Dockerfile (uvicorn CMD), deploy Space, `tests/smoke_test.py` green from cold start.

#### Wave 7 — README + demo + submission (T+13h → T+15h)

- `#38` *README + mini-blog + slide deck + video*: link block (Space `/health` `/metadata` `/benchmark`, training links, baseline scores, rollouts, evidence package); ≤ 2 min video.
- `#39` *Submission tracker* — flip the 20-item judge checklist green under each of the four weighted axes (40/30/20/10), then submit.

## 7. Submission gates (mirror `Submission/SubmissionChecklist.md`)

The 20-item judge checklist groups into 4 weighted axes:

- **Environment Innovation (40%)** — MissionOps mega-mission, real Rootly artifacts, scattered instructions, hidden dependencies, disturbance injection, planning actions, composable rubrics, evidence-gated remediation.

- **Reward Improvement (20%)** — Outcome × efficiency formula, baseline 4-row gap table, training curves, per-rubric attribution chart.
- **Reward & Training Pipeline (10%)** — `scripts/train_praxis_grpo.py` checked in, training run logs linked, mtGRPO multi-turn credit assignment, runtime + resource receipts.

Auto-validation gates (must be green):

- [ ] `pytest -q` ≥ 350 green (rubrics, artifacts, mission, planning, score, determinism, smoke).
- [ ] `uv run openenv validate` PASS.
- [ ] HF Space `/health`, `/metadata`, `/benchmark` 200 from a cold private window.
- [ ] `docs/baseline_scores.md` has 4 rows (random, no-memory, SRE-prompt, trained-Qwen) and the lift is ≥ 4× on the MissionOps mission.
- [ ] Runtime < 20 min on vCPU=2 / 8 GB on `tests/smoke_test.py`.
