praxis_env.scenarios.cascading_failure — Task 2: Cascading Failure.

Difficulty: Hard
Severity: P1
Max Steps: 20

Incident Summary:
  Multiple services alerting simultaneously — API is returning 503s,
  Auth is timing out, Payment service is slow. Three alerts fired at once,
  which is the first sign this is a cascading failure, not isolated.

Root cause: A runaway analytics pipeline launched a full-table scan
  against the production database at 14:45 UTC. This exhausted the
  database connection pool (100/100 connections used), leaving nothing
  for API, Auth, and Payment to connect. All three degrade simultaneously.

Red herrings (by design):
  1. API deployment happened 30 minutes ago — looks suspicious but
     unrelated. Post-deploy health checks were green.
  2. Auth service memory at 85% — elevated but within threshold.
     Red herring because it looks like a memory leak.
  3. Cache hit rate dropped — downstream symptom, not cause.
  4. Notification service deploy at 14:35 — suspicious timing but
     notification errors are downstream of DB pool exhaustion.

Optimal path (7 steps, score ~ 0.458):
    1. query_logs service=api timerange=10m          -> 503s citing DB timeout    (+0.024)
    2. check_deps service=api                        -> api->database dependency  (+0.024)
    3. check_metrics service=database metric=connections -> pool 100/100!         (+0.074)
    4. query_logs service=database timerange=15m     -> slow query from analytics (+0.044)
    5. diagnose root_cause=db_connection_pool_exhausted -> CORRECT               (+0.134)
    6. kill_query service=database query_id=runaway_analytics                    (+0.084)
    7. scale_resource service=database resource=connection_pool                  (+0.074)
                                                                                                                                            Total:   ~0.458

## MULTI-SERVICE INCIDENT

**Alert ID**: MULTI-001
**Severity**: P1 -- Major degradation (significant user impact)
**Triggered**: 14:47 UTC (3 alerts fired within 90 seconds)
**Duration**: ~5 minutes and worsening

**Active Alerts**:
- api-gateway:     HTTP 503 error rate 34% (threshold: 10%)
- auth:            Response timeout rate 28% (threshold: 5%)
- payment-service: Latency P95 = 8.4s (threshold: 2s)

**System status**:
- api:           critical
- auth:          critical
- payment:       degraded
- database:      degraded
- notification:  degraded
- analytics:     healthy (self-reported)
- cache:         degraded

**Context**:
- All 3 services began degrading within 90 seconds of each other
- API deployment v3.2.1 was released 30 minutes ago at 14:15 UTC
- Notification service was redeployed at 14:35 UTC
- This pattern (multi-service simultaneous degradation) suggests a shared dependency

Investigate the root cause. Multiple services are affected -- follow the dependency graph.\
